PROJECT with STATIC data - JUST STARTED, to be much enhanced !

Using PHP, JS (incl. jQ), CSS, HTML

The project would be used to generate gift suggestions using the ChatGPT API. The interactive element is a Form that allows users to enter preferences regarding sex, age, interests, maximum price and additional special features. Then, based on these preferences, gift suggestions will be generated.

Form integration with ChatGPT API - Documentation

File description:
index.php: contains a form that the user fills out to submit gift preferences. Once completed, the data will be sent to ChatGPT API and ultimately displayed in the generate_gifts.php file for processing and generating gift proposals via the POST method. If there was a ChatGPT API, a gift proposal would be generated.

Security:
When integrating an external API, it is important to ensure security measures. Here are a few of them:

Data validation: Before processing the data sent by the form, it should be validated (I have already used htmlspecialchars on the Back-end and partly on the Front-end) and check if all required fields are filled in and if the values are correct. This can be done both on the client side with validation in the form/JS and on the server side in the generate_gifts.php file.

Protection against XSS attacks: To protect an application against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), it is necessary to filter and encode the data that is displayed on the page. You can use functions like htmlspecialchars in PHP (as mentioned previously, I've already used htmlspecialchars) to convert special characters to the appropriate HTML entities.

Securing access to the API: If we use the paid ChatGPT API, make sure that appropriate security measures are in place, such as authentication and authorization. Keep API keys in a safe place and do not share them publicly.

Quantity limits: If the ChatGPT API has limits on the number of requests per unit of time, you should monitor and control the use of the API to avoid excessive consumption and unexpected costs.

Efficiency:
System performance should also be considered when integrating an external API. Here are some suggestions you can use to optimize performance:
Minimization of data sent to the API: Before transferring data to the API, the amount of information sent should be filtered and limited to the necessary minimum. Uploading only the data you need can help reduce the size of API requests and speed up response times.
Result Cache: If the gift suggestions generated by the ChatGPT API are persistent and do not change frequently, consider using a Result Cache. Thus, you can avoid calling the API multiple times for the same user preferences.
Asynchronous API Requests: If integration with the ChatGPT API requires a significant response time, consider using asynchronous API requests to avoid blocking the UI. This can be achieved using technologies such as AJAX or using JavaScript libraries such as fetch or axios.

Integration with the ChatGPT API

To integrate the form with the ChatGPT API:

Step 1: Configure the API
Access the ChatGPT API, which usually requires you to register and obtain an API key. Refer to the API documentation provided by OpenAI.

Step 2: Send a request to the ChatGPT API
Inside the generate_gifts.php file, we need to query the ChatGPT API to generate gift suggestions based on the user's choices.

Make sure your code supports proper authentication and security, such as API key authentication, to ensure secure access to the ChatGPT API.

Step 3: Processing the response from the API
After receiving a response from the ChatGPT API, we process it and adapt it to be displayed on the website.
We can use the data returned by the API to filter and sort gift suggestions based on various criteria.
We display gift suggestions
